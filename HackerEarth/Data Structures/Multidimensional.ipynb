    "# Monk and inversion \n",
    "Monk's best friend Micro, who happen to be an awesome programmer, got him an integer matrix M of size  for his birthday. Monk is taking coding classes from Micro. They have just completed array inversions and Monk was successful in writing a program to count the number of inversions in an array. Now, Micro has asked Monk to find out the number of inversion in the matrix M. Number of inversions, in a matrix is defined as the number of unordered pairs of cells  such that .\n",
