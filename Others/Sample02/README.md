# Question

Given an array n elements and a number m, we need to find all distinct pairs existing in the array whose pair sum is divisible by the given number m.  
Print the total of such pairs. Distinct pair means (1,2) and (2,1) are same. Ordering of pair doesn't matter.

### Input:
The first line will consists of one integer T denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case:
1) The first line consists of integers N denoting size of array
2) The next line consists of N space separated integers , denoting the elements of the array A.
3) Next line consists of integers M denoting given input number

### Output:
Print total pair whose sum is divisible by the given number m.
