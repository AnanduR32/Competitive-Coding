# 0-1 Knapsack Problem

In 0-1 Knapsack problem, we are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value and we need to determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.  
Here, items cannot be divided which means either should take the item as a whole or should leave it.

### Example

Knapsack maxCapacity = 5  
Profit = 60 50 70 30  
Weights = 5 3 4 2

Then the max profit we can get, by carrying minimum weight is 80  
Weight 3 and 2  
Profit 50 + 30 = 80
