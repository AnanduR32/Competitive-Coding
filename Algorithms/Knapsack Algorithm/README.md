# Knapsack Problem
The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization.  
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

### Example

Knapsack maxCapacity = 20  
Profit = 25 24 15  
Weights = 18 15 10

Then output should be 31.5
